  {{Sabrina}} woke up this morning being damn annoyed at her hair. It always looks like a mess after a night's sleep. But this morning is particularly stressful because she is running late to a meeting, a meeting which she didn't sign up for. Early this morning {{Sabrina}} got a phone call from her friend {{Lily}} who is an internationally renowned photographer. {{Lily}} apparently drank way too much at a gallery opening and had been throwing up all night. There was not way that she could make it to a photoshoot scheduled today. 
  "Why can't you just postpone it?" {{Sabrina}} asked while still half asleep.
  "Dude I wish I could duh! I called my assisant. But this person is apparently some big shot, and his schedule is ridiculously unflexible. The shoot was apparently scheduled 3 months ago and he's flying to another country this afternoon. Vogue will kill me if I mess up their magazine cover photo." said {{Lily}}
  "What?! This is for Vogue? And it's the cover photoshoot? Is this a joke? You are telling me that you want me to shoot a cover for Vogue in your place? Have you lost your mind?" {{Sabrina}} was shocked by her friend's request.
  "You will be fine. I have seen portraits you've done on your instagram. You have amazing athestics, and a natural grasp on light and framing. I know a great photographer when I see one. I will photoshop the photos afterwards. I've been doing this for a long time. Trust me, you will be fine." {{Lily}} said with much affirmation.
  "Um... No thanks. I can not handle this kind of pressure." {{Sabrina}} was not convinced.
  "Pleaseeee pleassseee. Just think of it this way. No matter how bad a job you do, it can not be worse than my not having photos at all.. I'm begging you. If I mess this up Vogue will never gives me gigs again. And they pay me well. I really need this. You know that I've been working really hard to have enough saving to open my own gallery." {{Lily}} started to choke on the other end of the phone.
  "Ahhh. I can't believe I'm saying this... But OK. I'll go. Send me the address." Somestimes {{Sabrina}} really wish she knew how to say no to a crying friend.
  In a hurry, {{Sabrina}} powdered her face slightly, put on rose-colored lipstick, threw on a lightblue cotton shirt and a pair of jeans, and jumped into a taxi."

  As the cab cruised through the streets of {{NewYork}} on this crisp morning, {{Sabrina}} felt a little bit calmer. {{Lily}}'s assistant had texted her the address of the photoshoot and said that she would be bringing all the equipments. When {{Sabrina}} showed the cab driver the address, the driver recognized the address and said that it's the new luxurious residential coumpound in the city. He had dropped off a famous actress there before, and he wished that the marvelous gardens in there were open to the public, so that he could take his kids to see the exotic trees shipped from South America on the weekend. Time went by fast as they chatted, and before {{Sabrina}} realized, the car had stopped in front of two grandiose golden gates. The driver buzzed at the security intercom, and a soft-spoken voice came through. 
  "Good morning. How can I help you?"
  Only until then had {{Sabrina}} realized that she didn't even know who was she meeting this morning. She fumbled on her phone and found the text from {{Lily}}'s assitant. 
  "Hi. I am meeting with Mr.{{Gong Yoo}} for a work appointment scheduled at 7am." As {{Sabrina}} said the name out loud, she thought to herself:"Wait a minute, {{Gong Yoo}}, isn't that the {{Korean}} {{actor}} who has been on literally every single magazine cover in the last month. All of her friends have been persuading her to watch the TV series that he stars in. {{Sabrina}} can not believe that {{Lily}} would trust her to shoot the famous {{actor}}. She also imagines her other friends screaming with OMG when she tells them about this.
  "Let me see... Is this Ms{{Lily}}?" The voice from intercom responded after a few seconds. 
  "Yes." Sabrina responded with much uncomfortableness. 
  "Great. Please come in and have the driver drop you off at the entrance by the fountain. I will see you in a second." As the intercom went silent the golden gates slowly opened its doors showing a grand drive way lined on both sides by tall plane trees.
  The security guard in black suits opened the taxi door for {{Sabrina}}, and led her to the glass elevator. When she stepped in the elevator and tried to press the floor buttons, she realized that she didn't know which floor she was going to. Just as she was going to ask the security guard, the button that writes "penthouse" lighted up. 
  When the elevator doors opened again, {{Sabrina}} saw a giant painting in the style of Jackson Pollock on the wall, some velvet chairs around it, and fresh flowers on wood cupboards. It took her 10 seconds to realize that she was in the apartment already.
   A white boy in a green t-shirt and a pair of sports shorts walked towards {{Sabrina}}. "Hi there! I'm Matt." He shook her hands with a big smile on his face. "I'm {{Yoo}'s assistant. What's your name?"
   "Hey. I'm um {{Lily}}." {{Sabrina}} secretly wished that she wouldn't have to introduce herself too many times today. It felt very creepy to use her friend's name, not mentioning the quentional ethics behind it. 
   "{{Yoo}} will be here in a minute. We just finished a tennis match and he needs a shower." Matt said. "Would you like a beer?"
   "Ummmm. No thanks I'm not a good drinker. I will probably knock the cameras down after just a few sips." {{Sabrina}} replied with an apologetic smile.
   "Hahahaha" Matt laughed out loud. "I'm kidding of course! It's 7am in the morning lady! I'll get you a coffee yeah?"
   "Oh..." {{Sabrina}} also laughed, feeling embarrased. "Thank you. That would be great."

The swap
It was hard to hear over the music, and Kelly thought she’d heard wrong. A Jager buzz verging on full-out drunk combined with the flashing lights, throbbing bass and cigarette smoke hanging in the air made the world feel as if it were turning upside down. “He wants to do what?” she asked again.

Hotel

The hotel room was a white dream of cleanliness. The coolness of the air conditioner tickled Ariel’s skin as she lay on the soft mattress, surrounded by pillows, sinking further into the thick, downy duvet. The blanket puffed up around her, as if she were floating on a cloud.

Abby swirled the amber liquid in her glass. It was a fine scotch, full of aroma and spice. A nice finish, not much kick on the back end - overall very smooth. She always felt sexy drinking it. It made her very aware of the way the silky, navy blue fabric felt on her skin. She also liked how little of it there was and how Darin looked at the smooth contours of her naked back.

Choose your Erotic Adventure:
Being the good guy
http://www.classyeroticstories.com/choose-your-erotic-adventure2.html
Even in his inebriated state, Ethan knew this wasn’t what he wanted. He wanted Amelia, sure, but not in some trashy, drunken fumble on the hood of her boyfriend’s car. He wanted a room with a view, so that they could watch the sun set over the water; share a bottle of expensive French wine; make love as many times as they could until exhaustion sent them both to dreamland.

“Amelia, I’m sorry - I …,” he didn’t know how to finish his sentence as he pushed himself off the car. He felt his cock twitch at the sight of her lithe body, one knee slightly raised and unconsciously fallen across centre, as if she was suddenly embarrassed at her lack of modesty. The flush in her cheeks was not passion.
