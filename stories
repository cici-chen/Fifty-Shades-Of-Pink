  "{{Sabrina}} woke up this morning being damn annoyed at her hair. It always looks like a mess after a night's sleep. But this morning is particularly stressful because she is running late to a meeting, a meeting which she didn't sign up for. Early this morning {{Sabrina}} got a phone call from her friend {{Lily}} who is an internationally renowned photographer. {{Lily}} apparently drank way too much at a gallery opening and had been throwing up all night. There was not way that she could make it to a photoshoot scheduled today. 
  "Why can't you just postpone it?" {{Sabrina}} asked while still half asleep.
  "Dude I wish I could duh! I called my assisant. But this person is apparently some big shot, and his schedule is ridiculously unflexible. The shoot was apparently scheduled 3 months ago and he's flying to another country this afternoon. Vogue will kill me if I mess up their magazine cover photo." said {{Lily}}
  "What?! This is for Vogue? And it's the cover photoshoot? Is this a joke? You are telling me that you want me to shoot a cover for Vogue in your place? Have you lost your mind?" {{Sabrina}} was shocked by her friend's request.
  "You will be fine. I have seen portraits you've done on your instagram. You have amazing athestics, and a natural grasp on light and framing. I know a great photographer when I see one. I will photoshop the photos afterwards. I've been doing this for a long time. Trust me, you will be fine." {{Lily}} said with much affirmation.
  "Um... No thanks. I can not handle this kind of pressure." {{Sabrina}} was not convinced.
  "Pleaseeee pleassseee. Just think of it this way. No matter how bad a job you do, it can not be worse than my not having photos at all.. I'm begging you. If I mess this up Vogue will never gives me gigs again. And they pay me well. I really need this. You know that I've been working really hard to have enough saving to open my own gallery." {{Lily}} started to choke on the other end of the phone.
  "Ahhh. I can't believe I'm saying this... But OK. I'll go. Send me the address." Saying no to a crying friend is not one of the skills that {{Sabrina}} has.
  Sabrina hurriedly throw on a jumpsuit and powedered her face slightly. Then jumped on a taxi.
