## MVP User stories
- [ ] As a user, I would like to type in my name and gender and another person's name and gender, and see chapter 1 of a story about us.
- [ ] As a user, the story is interesting enough that I will most likely to click through all three chapters of the story.
- [ ] As an administrator, I can see how many users finished reading their stories and how many did not.
- [ ] As a user, I would like to be able to read at least three different stories.
- [ ] As a user, I can click on a share button and send the story generated via email.
- [ ] As an administrator, I can change current story templates.

## Stretch goal #1
- [ ] As a user, I can choose to not have the names I've typed in to be seen by the administrator.
- [ ] As an administrator, if the user has chosen the privacy setting, I am not able to see the names users have typed in.
- [ ] As an administrator, I am able to store datas (names, places, etc) users have typed in for future fun  analytic purposes.

## Stretch goal #2
- [ ] As a user, I can type in other things other than names and gender such as places, to see them being incorporated in the story.
