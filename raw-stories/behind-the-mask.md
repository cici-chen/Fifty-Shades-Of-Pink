**Chapter 1**

"What the hell am I going to wear?" I wail, throwing yet another little black dress on the floor. Collapsing on my best friend Jessica's double bed, I groan and cover my face with one of the many cushions.

Taking a deep breath, Jess begins picking up the discarded LBDs littering her plush cream bedroom carpet. "You can borrow something of mine," she offers generously. "And don't pull that face."

I roll my eyes. "I doubt I'll fit into any of your clothes," I moan, tossing the cushion on the floor. "It's like Kim Kardashian offering to lend Beth Ditto her latest bandage dress."

Jess throws the cushion my head. "You look amazing and you know it."

It's true. After feeling like the 'fat friend' for too many years, I hit the gym hard six months ago and swapped wine o'clock for weight reps. The result? A toned size 12 body and an obsession with Steve, my hot personal trainer. Lying on the floor while he stretches my hamstring out has left me hot and flustered in more ways than one at the gym. I've definitely needed a long cold shower after most sessions.

Thoughts of Steve kneeling in front of me and pushing my leg up in the air flit across my mind and straight into my knickers. Before I'm brought back to earth by a thump on the head as Jess chucks yet another cushion at me.

Thinking about Jessica's 30th birthday party, I can't help but feel a glimmer of hope. It's tonight and there could be a few hot single men there – one I could maybe actually kiss, instead of just fantasising about. After all, it's not going to be a disco down the Nelson's Head with a few sausage rolls. With multi-millionaire parents, Jess is marking the occasion with a masked ball at the family home – a beautiful, country house in Surrey. Hence my wardrobe crisis…

"Here, try this," Jessica says.

"Woah!" I gasp. "I can't…" Jess is holding a beautiful strapless, emerald green, full-length dress in her arms. I take it from her and quickly strip to my bra and knickers before I can loose my nerve.

"Zip me up, quickly before I change my mind," I say. As the zip goes up, I smooth it down over my hips and know it's the One.

"You look stunning, hon,"' Jess smiles. "All the men will be wondering who the girl in the green dress with the green eyes is."

I pick up the mask I bought off the internet the week before and hold it up to my face. Black velvet, it does draw attention to my green eyes and will look dramatic with my long blonde hair too. While Jess will be spending most the night on the arm of her long-term boyfriend, Mark, I'm flying solo. Yet again.

"I really must check your final guest list for single men," I say. "You never know."

"It's with my parents now," Jessica says. "So god knows who they've added at the last minute – some dull old bloke business friends, I bet."

"Well, I've got first dibs on any eligible bachelors," I say. "As long as they're under 40."

**Chapter 2**

As the taxi sweeps up Jess's drive, I try to ignore the sick feeling growing inside me. I always get nervous before attending big social functions. Jessica is the life and soul of any party and, while I'm no wallflower, I prefer to stay out of the spotlight. Thankfully tonight is all about Jess. I'm just looking forward to catching up with some old university friends and hitting the dancefloor.

It seems like every light is on as I catch sight of Jessica's family home, Hollybush House. We met at uni a decade before and spent every student summer hanging out here, sunbathing by the outdoor pool, teasing Jess' younger brother James and avoiding her older brother Edward who was determined to wind us up at every given opportunity. When we graduated and got jobs, our holiday time suddenly seemed too precious to waste in rainy England when we could get a cheap flight to guaranteed sun. I can't believe I've not been back here for 10 years.

The gravel crunches under my heels as I tentatively step out of the cab, holding my clutch bag tightly against my left thigh to stop the split riding too high and exposing my skimpy, black lace knickers.

I can already feel a blush creeping its way up from my neck and try desperately to chill out. Taking a deep breath, I join the throng of guests as they enter the grand hallway to be greeted by Jess' parents.

"Allison, darling, you look divine," Jessica's mum says as she kisses me firmly on both cheeks before pulling me in for a long hug. She looks lovely in a black gown and simple black mask.

"Mrs. Johnson, thank you," I say, handing over my coat to an attendant hired for the night.

"How many times do I have to tell you? Please call me Diana," she scolds as her husband Simon moves towards us, wearing a Phantom of the Opera mask.

"Allison," he says, his eyes twinkling. "It's been too long. You look beautiful, even though we can't see most of your face behind that mask. We're so glad you could make it."

"I wouldn't miss if for the world," I say.

"Go find Jessica and have fun," he says, slipping an arm round my waist and guiding me towards to the dining room double doors where a hostess waits with a tray of crystal glasses filled with Moet.

**Chapter 3**

I quickly grab a champagne flute, downing half of it in one greedy gulp and enter the dining room. Decorated with fairy lights and candles, the furniture has been removed making enough space for the 150 guests due this evening. I rest my glass on the mantle piece, next to a family photograph. Simon and Diana stand proudly with James, Edward and Jessica sit in front of them. They look like the perfect family with their smiling eyes and dark, curly hair.

"Allie," Jessica squeals as she spots me. "I knew you'd look stunning."
She looks amazing too. Her deep red cocktail dress clings to her curves and is complimented by a beautiful red lace mask. Mark appears by her side. I sigh. The perfect couple. While Jess is petite and slim, Mark is 6ft 5in and built like a rugby player. Tonight, his handsome features are practically hidden behind his rubber mask. There's a definite hint of Batman about him.

"Here girls," he says, giving them both another glass of champagne.
"Sod it," I think, it's a party.
Jess grins widely. "I don't want you throwing up in the flower beds like you did at my 21st," she laughs.
"Don't remind me," I groan. "I've not touched tequila since."

Two hours later and the party is in full swing. While Jess' parents are settled in the library – which has been turned into a 'chill out' area for the more mature party guests – the rest of us have been tearing up the dance floor with Beyonce.

It's so hot. I open the French doors and slip outside. It's a beautiful night, the dark sky littered with stars blinking in Morse code. The cold air hits me straight away and the champagne I've been necking makes its effects known immediately. With goose bumps prickling my skin, I start making my way down the path to one of the benches dotted around the grounds. I can still hear Lady Gaga singing about her Pokerface as I begin to lift the velvet mask off my face to let my skin breath. Suddenly, there's am arm snaking round my waist. I laugh and turn, expecting to see Allie.

But stood in front of me is the most handsome man I've ever seen. He's at least 6ft with short black hair. His ocean blue eyes twinkle behind a Zorro mask. I take a step back and gasp.

**Chapter 4**

"Wait," he says quietly in a deep voice and reaches out to take hold of my left wrist. "Don't take your mask off."

Slowly, he draws me to him.

"Have we met?" I whisper. My heart is racing and I'm totally confused. A smile dances on his full lips and I can see his eyes crinkle slightly behind the mask. My stomach does a back-flip as he leans closer. I can feel his warm breath on my right earlobe and smell his musky aftershave. "You don't remember?" he smirks. It's more of a statement than question.

I shake my head, frowning. My arm begins to tingle and I realise he's still holding my wrist, slowly drawing circles on the inside of my arm. I steal a glance up at him, trying to place him. One of Jessica's cousins? A university fling I've forgotten? The son of her parents' friends? There must be a connection.

Suddenly, the nearby French doors open and Katy Perry screams out.
"Come," he says, taking my hand and we dip into the shadows.

Leading me carefully along a path, I realise he's taking me toward the swimming pool. He hasn't said a word but keeps turning round and smiling at me. Who the hell is he? Then I relaise I don't really care.

He stops outside the pool house and turns towards me. He glances over the top of my head before pulling me towards him.

"I…." I say, but his hands are already cupping my face and his lips have covered mine, silencing me.

A groan gathers in my throat as his tongue parts my lips, slipping into my mouth and begins a hot tango with my own. With one hand on the back of my head, fingers gathering a handful of hair, he pushes open the door behind himself and breaks away, pulling me into the summer house and quickly pushing the door shut behind me.

Letting go of my hand, he strides over and flicks on a small lamp in the corner before making his way back towards me, staring me down with his mesmerizing blue eyes. Glancing round, I take in my surroundings. The pool house is tastefully decorated like a seaside beach hut. An old fashion oak wooden table sits in the middle of the room while a day bed is covered in blankets and cushions to one side and a kitchen area takes up the other side. Stacked in the corner are sun loungers, chairs and a bal my knees weaken as he tips my chin up toward him and he dips down to begin gently kissing my neck.

My arm begins to tingle and I realise he's still holding my wrist, slowly drawing circles on the ins
A moan escapes as his hands begin to travel down my body and his kisses continue along my collarbone. I know I'm going to have him, here, right now. I can feel the heat radiating through his tuxedo shirt and as I use full advance of the high split in my dress and move my left leg between his thighs, his hard cock presses against me. I try to suppress a smile but it's as if he can hear my skin singing and he looks up, grinning too.

"Sssh," he says before guiding me backwards until my arse hits the wooden table. Lifting me gently up, my dress falls open at the split and I'm sat in front of him. I begin to take my mask off.

"No, leave it on," he growls. It doesn't look like he'll be taking his off either.

In two swift movements, he grabs a hand full of towels and sheds his jacket, slipping his hand into the inside pocket as he does. The foil of the condom packet catches the light and I sigh with relief and anticipation as he places the towels on the floor in front of me and one behind.

I inch my legs slightly apart, inviting him to explore me. He undoes his bowtie and I reach up to unbutton his shirt, splaying my hands on his broad chest that boasts a smattering of dark hair. Without breaking eye contact, he smiles, pushing dress up to my hips, fingers spidering their way up to the edge of my knickers.

**Chapter 5**

"Please…" I can't hold off any longer.

He finds the zip at the side of my dress with his other hand and pulls it down firmly, exposing my naked breasts.

"You're so wet," he whispers, pushing me down so I'm lying on the table and dipping his head slowly raining kisses across my stomach. "I want to taste you."

I hear him move and suddenly withdraw his fingers from inside me, leaving me empty. I raise my hips as he pulls my knickers down before pushing my thighs apart. His mouth traces a trail up my leg before he's on me, hot and greedy, his tongue delving into my folds before finally settling onto my clit, slowly circling.

Drawing my knees up, I open myself up and lay a hand on the top of his head, matching his strokes with my own. The familiar feeling of orgasm begins to build inside me.

"Don't stop,"' I groan, pushing myself into him, hanging onto the side of table for what seems like forever.

He slips his fingers back inside, quickly finding the ridges of that hidden place, complimenting his tongue and tipping me over the edge. The orgasm waves through me violently, traveling down my legs as I curl my toes.

Just as I steady myself to recover, I realize he's stood in front of me, stepping out of his trousers and tearing the foil packet.

Still woozy, I push myself up on my elbows. We're kissing passionately and I can taste myself still on his lips. Wrapping my legs around him, he takes his cock in his right hand and guides himself into my wetness.

Suddenly, he's picking me up and laying me down on the day bed and while my body is still tingling, I appreciate the softness after the hard, wooden table. With my legs still wrapped round him, he plunges deep into me.

"Allie…" he breaths into my ear.

We're kissing passionately and I can taste myself still on his lips

As my second orgasm builds, my mind is jumbled. I try to concentrate as he builds a rhythm – he knows my name. But he picks up the pace and I explode once again, with him pounding against me. He rears back, moans and slams into me one last time, catching the end of my orgasm by surprise. Then we're clinging to each other, sweaty and spent.
As our breathing steadies, I reach out and touch his mask. Although his eyes are glazed, he shakes his head. I lie back, confused. As I shiver, he pulls a blanket over us and strokes my hair.

"But who…" I ask before he places a finger on my lips. Frowning, I roll over and we spoon, holding hands and linking our fingers. I'm dazed and sleepy. And I realise I can no longer hear music coming from the house.

The party must be over, I think before I drift off…

**Chapter 6**

I throw the blanket off me, over heating and nearly fall off the bed. The sun is streaming through the floor to ceiling windows and doors, turning the pool house into what feels like a green house.

As memories of last night come flooding back, I realise I'm alone. Oh, right, it's like that, I think, kicking myself as disappointment overwhelms me. I put her head in my hands and I'm still wearing the bloody mask.

Tearing it off, I glance out the window to make sure no one is coming and stumble over to the table, only to find my dress folded neatly with my knickers on top.

"At least he has some manners," I say out loud as I slip them back on and zip up my dress.

Gathering my shoes, I make my way back up the path to the house, hoping I don't bump into anyone. I don't even know what time it is.

As I creep past the dining room, I hear chatter and duck down. But it's too late.

"Allison Wilcox," Jess squeals. "Get in here now."

Sheepishly, I open the French doors to face the whole Johnson family. Jess' boyfriend Mark and various friends are starring at me too.

"Morning," I say, looking only at Jess.

"What the hell happened to you?" she asks.

"I fell asleep in the pool house," I confess, leaving out the most interesting details of the evening.

I catch my reflection in the huge mirror hanging over the mantelpiece. Oh good grief, I think, rubbing the mascara furiously from under my eyes.

"Sit down, have some breakfast," Mark says, pouring me coffee.

I refuse to look at Jess' parents as a full English breakfast it put in front of me.

"Great night wasn't it?" Jess says, without a hint of a hangover. Bitch. "Last time I saw you, you were dancing to Single Ladies."

"Hmmm," I reply with a mouth full of toast.

"'And where the hell did you disappear to Zorro?" Jess asks. "If I didn't know better…"

For the second time in a matter of hours, my stomach flips and I look up sharply to see who Jessica is addressing.

He's sat opposite me and I've been totally oblivious. He's ditched the mask, and is wearing a blue V-neck jumper that matches his eyes exactly, but it's HIM! My fork falls to the floor with a clatter and he meets my stare with a wide smile.

"You remember my brother James, don't you Allie?" Jess asks innocently. "I know it's been a few years."

It's actually been just a few hours, but I nod my head slowly, with a grin to match his.

"'Of course I remember," I say, trying to steady my voice. "How could I forget?"

Cocking his head to one side, his eyes don't leave mine for a second. "Anyone fancy a dip after breakfast?" he asks, staring directly at me. I feel the blush creep into my cheeks. "The pool's ready for some action."

If anyone can get me wet, I think, it's James Johnson…
