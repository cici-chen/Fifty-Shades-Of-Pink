      {props.userName} woke up this morning being damn annoyed at {props.her} hair. It always looks like a mess after a night's sleep. But this morning is particularly stressful because {props.she} is running late to a meeting, a meeting which {props.she} didn't sign up for. Early this morning {props.userName} got a phone call from {props.her} friend {props.friendName} who is an internationally renowned photographer.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      {props.friendName} apparently drank way too much at a gallery opening and had been throwing up all night. There was not way that {props.friendName} could make it to a photoshoot scheduled today.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Why can't you just postpone it?" {props.userName} asked while still half asleep.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Dude I wish I could duh! I called my assisant. But this person is apparently some big shot, and {props.his} schedule is ridiculously unflexible. The shoot was apparently scheduled 3 months ago and {props.he} is flying to another country this afternoon. Vogue will kill me if I mess up their magazine cover photo." said {props.friendName}.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "What?! This is for Vogue? And it's the cover photoshoot? Is this a joke? You are telling me that you want me to pretend to be you and shoot a cover for Vogue? Have you lost your mind?" {props.userName} was shocked by {props.her} friend's request.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "You will be fine. I have seen portraits you've shot on your instagram. You have amazing athestics, and a natural grasp on light and framing. I know a great photographer when I see one. I will photoshop the photos afterwards. I've been doing this for a long time. Trust me, you will be fine." {props.friendName} said affirmatively.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Um... No thanks. I can not handle this kind of pressure." {props.userName} was not convinced.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Pleaseeee pleassseee. Just think of it this way. No matter how bad a job you do, it can not be worse than my not having photos at all.. I'm begging you. If I mess this up Vogue will never gives me gigs again. And they pay me well. I really need this. You know that I've been working really hard to have enough saving to open my own gallery." {props.friendName} started to choke on the other end of the phone.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Ahhh. I can't believe I'm saying this... But OK. I'll go. Send me the address." Somestimes {props.userName} really wish {props.she} knew how to say no to a crying friend.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      In a hurry, {props.userName} threw on a lightblue cotton shirt and a pair of jeans, and jumped into a taxi.
