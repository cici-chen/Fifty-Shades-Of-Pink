      {props.userName} inhaled deeply to fill {props.her} nose with the warm aroma of the big mug of hot coffee brewed from freshly grounded arabica beans in {props.her} hand. As {props.she} sipped on it while enjoying the morning sun shinning through the huge floor to ceiling windows, a blurry image of a tall {props.man} appeared in the reflection of the window.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <span className="text-capitalize">{props.she}</span> turned around finding a beautiful {props.man} smiling gentlely at {props.her}. As the {props.man} came closer to {props.her}, {props.userName} could smell a hint of woody coologne; it was calming and matching the decor of the space. <span className="text-capitalize">{props.he}</span> looked straight into {props.userName}{"'"}s eyes and said {"'"}Hi I'm {props.loverName}, how are you doing?{"'"} When {props.his} warm hands wrapped around {props.her}s, {props.userName} found {props.her}self unwillingly blushing, and {props.she} moved {props.her} gaze away from {props.his} eyes.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      During the photoshoot, as {props.loverName} gazed through the lense, {props.userName} couldn't help but find {props.herher}self smiling. It was like {props.he} was looking at you, and just you, with amazing tenderness and depth. There is sophistication in {props.his} eyes, but at times a childish innocence also comes out.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "How's the photoshoot going?" {props.loverName}{"'s"} assistant Matt came in and broke the silence. {"'"}{props.loverName} is a pro at this isn't {props.he}.{"'"}
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      {props.userName} looked at {props.her} watch and realized surprisingly that it had been an hour since the photoshoot started. "Oops sorry, lost track of time. Did you want to get some water or take a break?"
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "I thought you would never ask. I actually really need to pee." {props.loverName} said with a straight face. {"'"} Excuse me I'll be right back.{"'"}
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The photoshoot finished soon after {props.loverName} came back, {props.userName} had more photos of {props.loverName} looking dashing in them than {props.friendName} would ever need.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      {"'"}Well. Thank you very much {props.Mr}{props.loverName}. It was great. Thanks for being so patient with me.{"'"} said {props.userName}.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "It's my job," {props.loverName} replied with a gentle nod. "It was very relaxing working with you. Some photographers can really make you feel like you're a monkey you know.  Can I take a look at the photos we've got?"
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      {props.loverName} sat right next to {props.userName}, looking at the laptop screen together. {props.userName} really wish {props.she} had put on some cologne, and tried to act cool. They both reached for the laptop to go to the next photo, and their fingers touched for a brief moment. {props.userName} felt almost a tiny electronic shock emitting from {props.her} finger tip throught {props.her} body. {props.userName} chuckled nervously; {props.she} was too nervous to look at {props.loverName}{"'s"} face to see {props.his} reaction.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "These photos are excellent." {props.loverName} said to {props.userName} with a big smile.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Hey sorry to interrupt guys, but the driver is here. It's time for us to head to the airport." {props.loverName}{"'s"} assisant came in and made the annoucement.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Right. It was a pleasure meeting you. Leave your real name and number with Matt please. We will meet again." {props.loverName} shook {props.userName}{"'s"} hand while standing up. {"'"}{props.friendName} doesn't remeber, but we've met at a party before. Send my regards.{"'"} {props.loverName} winked at {props.userName}.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Oh ok. hahaha... Sorry about that... Have a good trip." {props.userName} felt like an idiot.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      That night, while {props.userName} was eating {props.her} dinner on the couch, {props.her} phone lit up with a text from an unknown number.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      It said {"'"}Hey there, this is {props.loverName}, hope you're enjoying your evening {props.userName}.{"'"}
