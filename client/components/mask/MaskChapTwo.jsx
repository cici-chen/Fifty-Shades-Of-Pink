      As the taxi sweeps up {friendName}{"'s"} door, {userName} tries to ignore the sick feeling growing inside her. She always gets nervous before attending big social functions. {friendName} is the life and soul of any party and, while {friendName} is no wallflower, she prefers to stay out of the spotlight. Thankfully tonight is all about {friendName}. {userName} is just looking forward to catching up with some old friends and hitting the dancefloor.

      The gravel crunches under {userName}{"'s"} heels as she tentatively steps out of the cab, holding her clutch bag tightly against her left thigh to stop the split riding too high and exposing her skimpy, black lace knickers.
      {userName} can already feel a blush creeping its way up from her neck and try desperately to chill out. Taking a deep breath, {userName} joins the throng of guests as they enter the grand hallway to be greeted by {friendName}{"'s"} parents.
      {"""}{userName}, darling, you look divine,{"""} {friendName}{"'"}s mum says as she kisses me firmly on both cheeks before pulling me in for a long hug. She looks lovely in a black gown and simple black mask.
      "Mrs. Johnson, thank you," I say, handing over my coat to an attendant hired for the night.
