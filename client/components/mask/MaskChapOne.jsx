      "What the hell am I going to wear?" {userName} wails, throwing yet another little black dress on the floor. Collapsing on her best friend {friendName}{"'"}s double bed, {userName} groans and covers her face with one of the many cushions.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "You can borrow something of mine," {friendName} offers generously. "I doubt I'll look good in any of your clothes," {userName} says, tossing the cushion on the floor. {friendName}  throws the cushion on {userName}{"'s"} head and says "You will look amazing and you know it."
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Tonight is {friendName}{"'s"} birthday party. {userName} can't help but feel a glimmer of hope. There could be a few hot single men there. What's more, it's not going to be a disco at the sketchy dive bar with a few sausage rolls. With multi-millionaire parents, {friendName} is marking the occasion with a masked ball at their family's beautiful, country house, which is why {userName} is having a wardrobe crisis...
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Here, try this," {friendName} says.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Woah!" {userName} gasp. "I can't..." {friendName} is holding a beautiful strapless, velvet, dark red, full-length dress in her arms.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Zip me up, quickly before I change my mind," {userName} says. As the zip goes up, {userName} smoothes it down over her hips and she knows that it's the One.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "You look stunning, hon," {friendName} smiles. "All the men will be looking at you haha."
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      {userName} picks up the mask she bought off the internet the week before and holds it up to her face. Black velvet does draw attention to her bright eyes. While {friendName} will be spending most the night on the arm of her long-term boyfriend, Mark, {userName} is flying solo. Yet again.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "I really must check your final guest list for single men," {userName} says. "You never know."
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "It's with my parents now," {friendName} says. "So god knows who they've added at the last minute â€“ some dull old bloke business friends, I bet."
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      "Well, I've got first dibs on any eligible bachelors," {userName} says. "As long as they're under 40."
