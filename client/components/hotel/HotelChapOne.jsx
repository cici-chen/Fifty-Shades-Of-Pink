      The hotel room was a white dream of cleanliness. The coolness of the air conditioner tickled {userName}{"â€™"}s skin as {she} lay on the soft mattress, surrounded by pillows, sinking further into the thick, downy duvet. The blanket puffed up around {herher}, as if {she} were floating on a cloud.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      From the bed, {she} could see out the window into the harbour, framed by snow-capped mountains. The sun was setting, casting a warm yellow hue across the city outside.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      {userName} closed {her} eyes and smiled, {her} hair cascading over the edge of the bed. {userName} thought, I could lay here forever.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Someone opened the door of the room. {userName} sat up and saw {loverName} walking in with a bottle of champagne in {his} hands. With a smile on {his} face and without speaking a word, {loverName} poured {userName} a glass and approached the bed.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      {loverName} handed {userName} the glass, and lifted {her} cotton sundress up, revealing {her} smooth legs and the hint of the curve of {her} ass. {userName} could see {loverName}{"'s"} private part hardening under {his} clothes.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      {loverName} placed a hand gently on {userName}{"'s"} ankle and sliding it up {her} calf, where {he} leaned down to place a gentle, but lingering kiss. {loverName} looked at {her} face as {he} dragged {his} fingertips along {her} leg. {userName} murmured, {she} smiled with {her} eyes closed.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      {loverName} gently but firmly grappled {userName}{"'s"} legs, spreaded them apart, and kissed up {her} inner thigh as {his} hand caressed the other. {userName} shifted, letting {her} legs open further as {loverName} placed kisses on {her} cotton panties.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Laying on {her} back, {userName} lazily stretched {her} arms up, then tilted {her} head to the side to look at the top of {loverName}{"'"} head. {userName} ran {her} fingers through {his} soft hair, and {he} smiled up at {her}. {loverName}{"'s'"} face is increbidly smooth, {userName} could feel {his} smooth skin rubbing against {her} thigh.
